A priority of the Beni Hassan @ Macquarie Project is to provide a detailed visual dictionary for all inscribed tombs at Beni Hassan, which draws on published and unpublished material collected by the Macquarie University expedition working at Beni Hassan (2009-present). The *Beni Hassan Visual Dictionary* contains accessible descriptions of the various themes, scenes, details and architectural features in a tomb, Jsesh transcriptions, transliteration, and translation of the hieroglyphic inscriptions, in addition to high resolution zoomable photographs and line drawings.

## Beni Hassan: Site overview

Beni Hassan is situated on the east bank of the Nile, approximately 250km south of Cairo and falls within the ancient boundaries of the 16th province or nome of Upper Egypt, which inscriptions refer to as the Oryx-nome. With excellent rock formation, the region possesses some of the best limestone in the country after Tura, the quarry that serviced the Memphite cemeteries to the north. The tombs at Beni Hassan, dating to the 6th-12th Dynasties spanning from the late Old Kingdom, First Intermediate Period and into the Middle Kingdom, are cut in two ridges half-way up the mountain and command an impressive view across the escarpment and the river Nile.

## The tomb of Khnumhotep II (Tomb 3)

Khnumhotep II served during the reign of pharaohs Amenemhat II and Senwosret II of the 12th Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom period (c. 1918-1884 BCE). He held the titles of 'hereditary prince', 'count', 'count of the town of Menat-Khufu' (an important local settlement near Beni Hassan), 'overseer of the Eastern Desert', 'overseer of priests' as well as priesthoods in a number of temples dedicated to deities such as Horus, Anubis and the lioness goddess Pakhet. The fa√ßade of the tomb is cut into the face of the cliff and, alongside the tomb of Amenemhat (Tomb 2), presents a most imposing and dominating symbol of the elite governance that was likely visible from the local settlement. The visual program in the tomb is almost completely intact and retains much of the original vibrant colour and intricate details, which are featured in the entries below.
