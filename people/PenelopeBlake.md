Penelope Blake is an undergraduate student in her final year of a Bachelor of Ancient History at Macquarie University. She specializes in Egyptology, with particular interest in the areas of language, writing and religion. Within the Beni Hassan Research Project, she is part of a team gathering and processing data on architectural features, inscriptions and imagery from the tombs of Beni Hassan. The team has selected, described and analysed key examples of wall-paintings, autobiographical inscriptions and architectural features from the tomb of Khnumhotep II. As part of this project, Penelope has established a system of Unicode characters for the display of hieroglyphic transliterations on web pages. She has also created a hierarchy of all of the details and scenes from the tombâ€™s wall-paintings, so that each individual scene or detail may be located and considered within the wider context of the surrounding scenes and scene types.
