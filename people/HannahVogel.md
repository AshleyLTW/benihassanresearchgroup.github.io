Hannah Vogel is an undergraduate student in her final year of a Bachelor of Ancient History at Macquarie University. She has also studied archaeology on exchange at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and participated in a study tour of surveying many of the archaeological sites in Egypt. Hannah specializes in Egyptology, with particular interest in the areas of ethnicity, archaeology, foreign relations and art.

Within the Beni Hassan @ Macquarie Project, she has collaborated with the team to select, describe and analyse key examples of wall-paintings, autobiographical inscriptions and architectural features from the tomb of Khnumhotep II. Hannah's particular focus has been on describing and analysing the scene of the procession of Asiatics, to allow a greater accessibility to this wonderful tomb for a larger audience.
