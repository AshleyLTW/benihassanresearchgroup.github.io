Kirstyn Baker has completed her Bachelor of Arts degree (2015-2017) majoring in Ancient Egypt and the Near East at Macquarie University. She is now undertaking the Master of Ancient History degree also at Macquarie University. Her main interests within Egyptology include Predynastic, Early Dynastic, Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom with an emphasis on art and iconography.
Within the Beni Hassan Research Project Kirstyn has assisted in the culmination and processing of data from the tomb of Khnumhotep II at Beni Hassan. The team has been working together to analyse and present the wall painting, inscriptions and architectural features to the public so as to allow access to the beautiful and unique tombs at Beni Hassan for a larger audience.
Kirstyn has been involved in another project which includes documenting and assessing the condition of the many ancient artefacts in the Museum of Ancient Cultures at Macquarie University.
