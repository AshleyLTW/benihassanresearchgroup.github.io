Linda Evans is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Ancient History, Macquarie University. She studied Classical Studies (1980) and Psychology (Honours; 1981) at the University of Adelaide before working in the field of Biology (animal communication and behaviour) in the United States. Upon returning to Australia in 1993, she completed an MA (1998) and PhD (2007) in Egyptology at Macquarie University. Her research draws on her background in both Biology and Classical Studies/Egyptology by examining the relationship between humans and non-human animals in the ancient world as reflected in religious ideas, symbolism, and especially art.
