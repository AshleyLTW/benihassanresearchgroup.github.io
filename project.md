# Beni Hassan @ Macquarie has three aims:

## 1. to provide a comprehensive and accurate published record of a rare and endangered archaeological site. 

With permission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, the team will undertake a precise record of the architectural features, inscriptions and imagery contained in each tomb. 

A new record of the decorated tombs at the site is essential, as the early tomb publications by Percy Newberry and his colleagues (1893-1900) are problematical. The photographs of the walls are inadequate by modern standards, while the figures in the line drawings are rendered in solid black, obscuring many significant details. More importantly, epigraphic work by Kanawati on the tomb of Khnumhotep II (Kanawati and Evans, 2014) has shown that their record is frequently inaccurate and furthermore, that some material was deliberately omitted.

## 2. to isolate patterns of regional diversity, continuity and/or innovation during the Old Kingdom,  First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom in royal and elite tomb imagery.

Various scholars have noted that a salient feature of Middle Kingdom is extensive use of 'archaism', or a conscious emulation or imitation of form, type and style from earlier periods, which have been long out of use (see summary in Kahl 2010). The trend was first adopted by Theban rulers in the 11th Dynasty and saw a reversion to earlier Old Kingdom (Dynasties 4-6) canonical artistic traditions and models of sculpture and relief, which became the state sanctioned style of the 11th and 12th Dynasties in the capital Thebes and in many regional cemeteries in Upper Egypt (Freed 1997).

The project aims to establish a database incorporating consistent descriptors of 2 Dimensional visual material from royal and elite cemeteries from all regions in Egypt to enable comparison of form across periods and isolate key areas of continuity and innovation. The results of the project will build a clear picture of artistic tradition and decorum in royal and elite monuments as well as artisan practices in the lead up to the re-formation of the Egyptian state during the early Middle Kingdom.
