  An Egyptian official described as identified as <span class='italic'>sš Ꜥ(w) nswt Nfr-ḥtp</span> 'the scribe of the royal documents, Noferhotep' bows and presents an unrolled papyrus to the tomb owner, which announces the arrival of a group of Asiatics. This detail occurs in the larger scene of the Asiatic procession on the chapel's north wall. The scroll reads <span class='italic'>rnpt-sp 6 ḫr ḥm n Ḥr sšm tꜢwj nswt-bjtj ḪꜤ-ḫpr-RꜤ rḫt n ꜤꜢmw jn.n sꜢ ḥꜢtj-Ꜥ H̱nmw-ḥtp(.w) ḥr msdmt m ꜤꜢmw n Šw rḫt jr 37</span> 'regnal year 6 under the Majesty of Horus, Leader of the Two Lands, King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Khakheperre (Senwosret II); the number of Asiatics whom the son of the count, Khnumhotep, brought on account of the black eye-paint, namely Asiatics of Shu, number amounting to 37'. A detail of Neferhotep holding the scroll can be seen <a href="/gallery/42a/">here</a>.
