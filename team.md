## Australian Research Council Discovery Project Investigators
The Beni Hassan @ Macquarie Project is supported by an Australian Research Council Discovery Project grant from 2016-2018, and is a collaboration between Macquarie University and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

This project aims to produce new insights into the meaning of Eqyptian tomb art. Tomb paintings are a primary source of information about ancient Egyptian life, but what was the original purpose of this art? Previous hypotheses have proposed a range of personal, social or religious functions, but the question remains unresolved. The project aims to break through this impasse by testing the validity of the most comprehensive theory to date via an innovative visual and statistical analysis of wall paintings at the Middle Kingdom site of Beni Hassan. The results are expected to bring greater clarity to our understanding of Egyptian art, and so allow an objective evaluation of its use as a historical document.
