## Location

Egypt, Beni Hassan, Upper Cemetery. Tomb of Khnumhotep II (Tomb 3). Chapel. Inscription: East wall, Lower section.

## Description

This register contains one of the most recognisable scenes of foreigners in Egyptian Pharaonic history: the arrival of a group of Asiatics, which is located on the chapel's north wall. The scene is clearly described as *jjt ḥr jnt msdmt jn n.f ꜤꜢm 37* 'arriving and bringing black eye-paint, which 37 Asiatics brought to him'. Two men of non-Egyptian origin, refered to as *ꜤꜢmw* 'Asiatics', bring animals and offerings to the tomb owner, preceded by two Egyptians announcing their arrival. The two Asiatics have yellow-painted skin, large hooked noses, and greyish-blue eyes and sport short pointed beards with coiffed, mushroom hairstyles. They wear brightly coloured and patterned clothing speckled in red, blue and white. 

The first Egyptian man on the right is identified as *sš Ꜥ(w) nswt Nfr-ḥtp* 'the scribe of the royal documents, Noferhotep'. He bows before Khnumhotep II while holding a rolled papyrus in one hand and presenting him with another unfolded document. On it is written: *rnpt-sp 6 ḫr ḥm n Ḥr sšm tꜢwj nswt-bjtj ḪꜤ-ḫpr-RꜤ rḫt n ꜤꜢmw jn.n sꜢ ḥꜢtj-Ꜥ H̱nmw-ḥtp(.w) ḥr msdmt m ꜤꜢmw n Šw rḫt jr 37* 'regnal year 6 under the Majesty of Horus, Leader of the Two Lands, King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Khakheperre (Senwosret II); the number of Asiatics whom the son of the count, Khnumhotep, brought on account of the black eye-paint, namely Asiatics of Shu, number amounting to 37'. The unfolded document can be [seen here in more detail](/gallery/43a). The second man is labelled *jmj-r nww H̱tjj* 'the overseer of hunters, Khety'.

The first foreigner in the procession, described as *ḥḳꜢ ḫꜢst JbšꜢ* 'ruler of a foreign land, Ibsha', presents the first recorded Middle Kingdom usage of the title. Scholars agree on a northwest Semitic origin for *JbšꜢ*'s name and has been equated with Abi-shai ('my father is king'), and Abi-sharie ('my father is strong'). Artistically distinct from the other men in his retinue, *JbšꜢ* wears the most colourful knee-length garment, which is draped over one shoulder with the other bare but for a white detail connecting the fabrics (possibly a pin). Intricate patterns and fringing along the sides of the garment point to it as a woollen textile. *JbšꜢ* bends forwards and holds in his left hand a banded, curved-stick with which he controls a Nubian ibex (*Capra ibex nubiana*) and his right hand is extended with palm open, facing down. 

The barefoot man adjacent to *JbšꜢ* wears a colourfully banded kilt with a wavy waistline and is represented with a unique object hanging at the tip of his beard. Lack of parallels restricts its identification, but perhaps it is a jewelled adornment or a water (possibly sweat) droplet. The man's lower body is hidden by a dorcas gazelle (*Gazella dorcas*), which he holds by the horn in his right hand and by the neck with a rope in his left hand. As he shares artistic details with the leader before him (both guide an animal, and are barefoot) but remains distinct from the men behind him in clothing and adornment, it is suggested here that this 'gazelle tamer' is the second-in-command of the foreigners.
