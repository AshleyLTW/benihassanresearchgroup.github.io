## Description

An Egyptian official described as identified as *sš Ꜥ(w) nswt Nfr-ḥtp* 'the scribe of the royal documents, Noferhotep' bows and presents an unrolled papyrus to the tomb owner, which announces the arrival of a group of Asiatics. This detail occurs in the larger scene of the Asiatic procession on the chapel's north wall <Kanawati & Evans, BH1, Pl. 29.:Beni Hassan:Upper Cemetery:12th Dynasty:Khnumhotep II (Tomb 3):Chapel:Architectural feature:North wall::Wall:::>. The scroll reads *rnpt-sp 6 ḫr ḥm n Ḥr sšm tꜢwj nswt-bjtj ḪꜤ-ḫpr-RꜤ rḫt n ꜤꜢmw jn.n sꜢ ḥꜢtj-Ꜥ H̱nmw-ḥtp(.w) ḥr msdmt m ꜤꜢmw n Šw rḫt jr 37* 'regnal year 6 under the Majesty of Horus, Leader of the Two Lands, King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Khakheperre (Senwosret II); the number of Asiatics whom the son of the count, Khnumhotep, brought on account of the black eye-paint, namely Asiatics of Shu, number amounting to 37'. A detail of Neferhotep holding the scroll can be seen [here](/gallery/42a).
